$ python easy/guess_the_number.py
Welcome to the Guess the Number Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Enter your guess: 123
Too high! Try again.
Enter your guess:

$ python easy/mad_libs_generator.py
Enter prompt: There once was a cat
Story: There once was a cat that seemed to run on the sidewalk for hours. Today it is a cat, not a dog. As in, it has to look like, well, the same cat that was sitting at one end. And the second time it did, it looked just like her; I found all of her bones missing and I asked, okay, what did she look like? And it looked like like a cat that would be out of shape.
